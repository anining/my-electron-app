This is a new repository.

Please perform a quick onboarding pass:

1. Repo map

- Summarize the top-level structure and the primary entry points.

2. Stack & tooling

- Identify the framework/runtime, language, package manager, and build/test tooling.
- Note any CI/CD or build services configured.

3. Constraints & invariants

- Infer stable constraints from configuration (e.g., platform targets, required Node version, architecture mode, environment/config conventions).
- Call out any “must not do” pitfalls you can confidently infer.

Then propose an initial update to AGENTS.md in one of these forms:

- a unified diff against AGENTS.md (preferred), or
- the full revised AGENTS.md if restructuring is necessary.

Follow the AGENTS.md Update Rule strictly.
Output only the diff or the revised file—no commentary.

Update AGENTS.md based on this session.

Please read AGENTS.md and treat it as authoritative context for this session.
Confirm understanding.
